# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification

A beginner-friendly **Machine Learning project** that predicts the type of Iris flower — *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, or *Virginica* — based on sepal and petal dimensions.
This project uses the **Logistic Regression** algorithm to classify flowers and demonstrates the complete ML workflow from data loading to prediction.

## 📘 Project Overview

The Iris dataset is one of the most famous datasets in the Machine Learning community.
It consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features:

* Sepal Length
* Sepal Width
* Petal Length
* Petal Width

The goal is to predict the **species** of the flower:

* 0 → Setosa
* 1 → Versicolor
* 2 → Virginica

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ Load and explore the Iris dataset
✅ Preprocess and scale data using `StandardScaler`
✅ Train a **Logistic Regression** model
✅ Evaluate model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
✅ Predict flower species for new input data

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, scikit-learn

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset is included within **scikit-learn** — no download needed:

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
iris = load_iris()
```
